I am static text and have been generated by a template.

<%= p.helloMessage =%>, I am dynamic and have been passed into the template instance.


This is fully dynamic list built by a loop calling a macro, inside the template:

<% for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { %>
	* <%= i =%>. Number <%= p.someNumber =%> (dynamically passed into template)
<%} %>


<% // I am a comment which will not be rendered in instances generated by this Template %>
