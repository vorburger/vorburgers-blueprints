* SDO: Why does gen. interface Name not extend DataObject, only NameImpl ?! 
	change back in HelloWorldClientTestCase & HelloWorldClient

* SDO: Helper to wrap an DataObject in a strongly typed interface (with dyn proxy) ?
	T SDOStaticTypeHelper.as(DataObject o, Class<T> klass)

* Dynamic Provider (Server)

* How-to run this outside Tuscany "container" (classloader etc), just simply "embedded" ?

* Update to Tuscany 2.0 instead of 1.6
* EMF Update?

* Clear out HelloWorldServiceComponent - only confusing, no value in this example

* Why is WSDL even needed? Base helloworld-webservice doesn't have one, and seems to create it on the fly - how to do same with this?

* REST!  See helloworld-jaxrs/helloworld-jsonp/helloworld-jsonrpc base examples

* Binary Serialization (no XML or JSON), like e.g. helloworld-scaclient, but must it use hazelcast?)

* DAS?

* Integrate into Tuscany distribution?

* Jetty instead Tomcat
	should remove stuff like WARNING: Could not get url for /javax/servlet/jsp/resources/jsp_2_0.xsd
	
* Why SEVERE: XMLSchema validation error occured in: null ,line = 22, column = 5, Message = cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'component'. One of '{WC[##other:"http://www.osoa.org/xmlns/sca/1.0"]}' is expected.
