disrest = Di's REST ;)
	because when I was hacking this Di (rightfully) suggested I rest :) some, thus the ACK.

	
TODO
	write test 
	extend test to assert that 'back-end' is not called when it shouldn't

	flesh out dyn API, write test
	
	multiple... not "representations" (as that's binary vs. XML vs. JSON vs. XHTML) but "views", e.g. a UserInfo & UserFull
	
	impl.statcbean, impl.dyn

	build REST front-end, use 2-3 REST frameworks..
		
	study SDO!  mostly interesting for its change tracking for writing, not so relevant for read-only?
