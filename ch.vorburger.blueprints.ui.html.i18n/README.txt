This is a small library for internationalizing (i18n) HTML & XML templates.

It is inspired but what is found in Wicket (see https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/everything-about-wicket-internationalization.html),
but is completely Web framework independent. (A separate module which depends on this binds this to a Vaadin CustomLayout.)

http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinderI18n.html is interesting as well in this context.

http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideI18n.html and http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/Constants.html
have an interesting statically typed approach for Message keys (not used here, as not applicable to HTML templates).
