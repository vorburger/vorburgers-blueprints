Check if handles https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-3433 better?

Write a TranslatableCustomLayout, in a new ch.vorburger.blueprints.ui.vaadin.i18n.customlayout module
notify http://dev.vaadin.com/browser/contrib/tpt/projects/tpt/src/eu/livotov/tpt/i18n/TranslatableCustomLayout.java
Package that as a Component for the Directory?

Implement idea for inline translations, 
via <i18n:translation lang="de" text="Dritter Punkt" />
in sample-transitional_withSomeInlineTranslationIdea.html
Vaadin & GWT templates both don't do this - I just thought this could be fun.

Integrate a CMS-like live translation change in app (e.g. Ctrl-Click on Labels)

It would be cool if there was an Eclipse Plug-In to support 
menu Source > Externalize Strings for the HTML/XML Editor!
	It could support e.g. both my proposed syntax from this project
	(intended for use in Vaadin CustomLayout), as well as e.g. Wicket HTML.

Test that respective property files can *override* the content from the XML (or the other way around; actually, which one should be stronger?!)

Test that labels already defined in the xml:lang of the template don't
have to be repeated in a respective property files - they are used as is.
They are not hard-coded / default to 'en' though - the xml:lang must be read.

Implement idea using embedded i18n:attribute,
instead of i18n:message="alt:logo.alt.intag, title:logo.title.intag"  
like so:
		<!-- This alternative syntax is allowed as well: -->
		<img src="/images/logo2.png" alt="Company Logo" title="This is the Company Logo">
				<i18n:attribute name="alt" key="logo.alt"  /> 
				<i18n:attribute name="title" key="logo.title" />
		</img>

Define a XSD schema for i18n
add it in sample-strict.xhtml header
